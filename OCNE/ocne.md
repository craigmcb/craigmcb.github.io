This site contains videos to facilitate your usage of the technologies, software and tools used by Oracle to develop microservices-based applications that can be deployed in environments that support open standards and specifications.

On these pages you will find material such as videos, documents and useful resource links covering areas including the following:
- Container Runtime
- Orchestration and Deployment
- Microservices Traffic Management
- Management Operations
- Monitoring

Information and videos presented here cover Microservices technologies which are components of the Oracle Cloud Native Environment General Availability announcement, as well as additional technologies to help you expand your learning of microservices.

### Kubernetes Videos
An open-source system for automating the deployment, scaling and management of containerized applications, Kubernetes provides the tools to build a cluster of systems to support the launching of containerized applications. These containers can be deployed across the cluster systems and scaled as needed.

The following videos will introduce you to the Kubernetes cluster technology and its components. They show how a Kubernetes cluster is built, and how container applications in pods are deployed on the cluster nodes.
